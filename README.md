# Etch-A-Sketch

Your very own personal sketch book that you can play around with.

Features:

1. Gives you a default 16x16 to play around with.

2. If the user wants, the grid can be resized to contain as many cells as they want(within 100).

3. User can choose from multiple colors, default is black.

NOTE: the reason the max number of cells is 100 is that, anything above a 100x100 grid would take a while to generate, potentially lag and might even crash your browser.
